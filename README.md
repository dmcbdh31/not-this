What was the biggest challenge of scraping the website?
  The error I had gotten when importing Selenium. I typed everything out as I was supposed to, installed selenium like I was supposed to. However, when I went to import it, Python gave me an error.
  
What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualization of the laptop data?
